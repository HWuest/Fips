## Motivation
The biggest problem for deafblind people is social isolation.
Ofcourse they can read books printed in Braille or write a letter using a Braille keyboard, but this is not the same as talking with somebody.
## The aim of the project
is to provide a technical solution which allows deafblind people to talk with somebody as similar to a normal talk as possible.
