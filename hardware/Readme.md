## Hardware
We have a sender and a receiver device.

The schematics are fips-sender.pdf and fips-receiver.pdf.

The sender device has a printed circuit board for easier connection of parts.

The top side of the board holds the keys and a LED (keys not shown in the picture ![top side](fips-sender-uC-board-topside.jpg)

The bottom side holds the ESP32 microcontroller board and some other components. ![top side](fips-sender-uC-bottomside.jpg)
